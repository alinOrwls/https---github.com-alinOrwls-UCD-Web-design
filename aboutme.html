    <p>
    I was born and raised in Mexico City; however, I've been residing in Ireland for the past 7 years. I pursued my
    education in Computer Engineering at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM), which remains a prominent
    institution in Latin America and ranks as the second-best in the region. <br>
    
    My passion for coding ignited during my high school years when I enrolled in courses on HTML and C++. These experiences
    completely captivated my interest, and I knew that coding was the right path for me. However, after completing my
    bachelor's degree, I made the decision to delve into the cybersecurity field, as it was considered one of the most
    promising careers in Mexico. <br>
    
    It wasn't long before I realized that I am a creator at heart. I have a deep appreciation for art and a strong desire to
    build and design. This realization prompted me to return to the world of coding. I am fervently dedicated to crafting
    web pages and applications that not only captivate people but also enhance their efficiency and productivity.<br>

    I have an insatiable love for learning, and I'm constantly in pursuit of new knowledge. My diverse set of hobbies
    reflects this passion: I enjoy painting, knitting, sewing, and I'm actively engaged in learning Japanese and Korean.
    Additionally, I find joy in decorating my home and taking on DIY projects.
    
    Among all my interests, traveling is the one that truly inspires me the most. Exploring different parts of the world is
    an unparalleled source of inspiration and fulfillment for me. I've been fortunate to visit 15 countries so far, and I'm
    eagerly looking forward to expanding that list as I continue my adventures.
